# Fibonacci implementation

This project is an attempt to optimize regular stack based recursion with trampolines

> TRAMPOLINING is a functional programming concnept allowing to transform stack based recursion to iteration

Take a look at `ruby/main.rb` or `python/main.py` for implementation details
