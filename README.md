# Fibonacci implementation

This project is an attempt to optimize regular recursion call with stack usage with trampolines (TRAMPOLINING is a functional programming concnept allowing to transform stack based recursion to iteration)

> Take a look at main.rb for implementation details

## Getting Started

`git clone` cd into project and `bundle install`

## Running the tests

run `ruby main.rb` in project directory
